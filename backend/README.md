This folder contains the backend server for the d8n project. It is responsible for handling API requests, managing business logic, and interacting with other services.

## Structure

- `package.json`: Node.js dependencies and scripts.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Notes
