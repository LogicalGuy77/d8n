## What is d8n?

d8n is a powerful automation tool that lets you create complex, conditional workflows for DeFi without writing a single line of code. From arbitrage strategies to automated payments, d8n provides a visual canvas to connect different DeFi protocols and services.

Build any logic you can imagine. The d8n engine executes your custom workflows based on real-time on-chain events and data, turning complex strategies into automated actions.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### 1. Unmatched Customizability & Logic
- **Build Anything**: Create workflows for any DeFi scenario, from simple token swaps to complex, multi-step arbitrage strategies.
- **Conditional Execution**: Use conditional nodes to create sophisticated logic that reacts to market changes, on-chain events, or data from oracles.
- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Design, test, and deploy your logic using an intuitive drag-and-drop canvas. No coding required.

### 2. Advanced DeFi Automation with Pyth Network
- **Query High-Frequency Data**: Access Pyth's real-time price feeds for crypto, equities, FX, and commodities to power your workflows. Use this data to trigger actions, make decisions, or calculate values.
- **Push Data On-Chain**: Uniquely, d8n workflows can also *push* data back to the Pyth network after execution, contributing to the robustness of the oracle.

### 3. Powerful Trading with the 1inch Limit Order Protocol
- **Build Advanced Strategies**: Create sophisticated trading hooks and strategies for the 1inch Limit Order Protocol.
- **Automate Limit Orders**: Set up workflows that automatically place, modify, or cancel limit orders based on market conditions or other on-chain events.

### 4. Composable & Shareable Workflows with The Graph
- **Store Workflows on Hypergraph**: Save your custom workflows as "black boxes" on The Graph's Hypergraph.
- **Create "DeFi Legos"**: This makes your workflows composable and shareable, allowing others to integrate your logic into their own systems, creating a true ecosystem of "DeFi legos."

## ðŸ§© How It Works
1.  **Frontend**: A user-friendly interface to build, test, and manage your workflows by dragging and dropping nodes.
2.  **Signer**: A secure component that handles the authorization and signing of transactions required to execute your workflows.
3.  **Engine**: The decentralized backend that continuously monitors on-chain conditions, parses your workflow logic, and executes transactions when the predefined conditions are met.

## ðŸ’¡ Why d8n?
- **No-Code Simplicity**: Build complex DeFi strategies without being a developer.
- **Limitless Logic**: The only limit is your imagination. If you can map it out, you can automate it.
- **True Automation**: Set it once, and let the engine run it for you.
- **Composable & Open**: Share your workflows and use others' to build even more powerful systems.
- **Integrate Exclusive Features**: Leverage the best of Pyth, 1inch, and The Graph in one platform.
