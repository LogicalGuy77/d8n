# Contracts

This folder contains smart contracts and related resources for the d8n project.

## Structure
- `src/`: Solidity source files.
- `Delegate.sol`: Example contract.
- `foundry.toml`: Foundry configuration for building and testing contracts.

## Getting Started
1. Install Foundry (see https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).
2. Build contracts:
   ```bash
   forge build
   ```
3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   forge test
   ```

## Notes
- Contracts are written in Solidity.
- Use Foundry for development and testing.
